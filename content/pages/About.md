Title: About

As a fellow data enthusiast, I have been thinking of setting up a blog or website to get 
in touch with the wonderful data science community. Also I envisioned this platform to 
improve my skills and be relevant with the rapid changes happening in the data field.
I will be posting notebooks related to projects that I am working on and articles on newest
technologies that I am learning and implementing in the projects. Please provide
constructive feedback that could help me overcome any shortcomings. If you find anything
useful, please like or share.

For living I work as a Technical Solutions Architect at a mining solutions company. 
I am responsible for information management architecture, data integration, 
data quality, application integration and performance optimization. I am Passionate about 
enabling organizations to embrace analytics and foster data driven decision making process 
by integrating enterprise business application data using industry preferred data-
integration tools.

I love to play tennis and currently working on a pet project to explore tennis dataset and
create an interesting data application from it. Here is the link to the application that
I am actively developing [serve-aces](https://serve-aces.herokuapp.com/)
